Customer service campaign
Recruitment project example

Details
A huge telecommunication company had a successful year and just recently started a new campaign to
reward their loyal customers (provided) with a discount on new purchases. Each day for one week
agents have to fill out the custom form to reward some of them with a daily limit of 5 customers per
agent. Mistakes are possible.
One month after this campaign they will get a .csv report with customers that have made a successful
purchase and they want to merge this data to show the results through API.
Since they want to reuse this scenario in different CRM solutions they have, securely exposed APIs are
required with ease of integration.

The main goal of the task is to simulate real case scenario with the architecture setup to answer future
needs and easy maintenance.
